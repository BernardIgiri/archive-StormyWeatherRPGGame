# Stormy Weather RPG game

*This project is preserved mostly as an old archive of my past work*

**Project Date**
: 2000-2001

**Status**
: Archive *(incomplete)*

**Technologies**
: C++

This was my first attempt at making a game in C++. This game used 8 bit graphics and PC speaker audio. The development on this game never got passed the intro screen.
